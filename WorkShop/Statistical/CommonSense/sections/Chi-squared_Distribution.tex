\subsection{Definition}

If $Y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, then
\begin{equation}
    \chi^2 \equiv \sum_{i = 1}^{r} Y_i^2
\end{equation}
is distributed as Chi-squared \emph{$\chi^2$} distribution with $r$ degrees of freedom.
The symbolic notion is $p_r(x) \sim \chi^2(r)$.

The pdf of Chi-squared distribution is
\begin{equation}
    p_r(x) = \frac{x^{r/2-1} e^{-x/2}}{\Gamma(r/2) 2^{r/2}}, 0 < x < \infty
\end{equation}

The proof can be found in Lemma \ref{lemma: Compute the pdf of Chi-squared distribution} and Lemma \ref{lemma: The pdf of Chi-squared distribution is a pdf}.

\subsection{Relationship with Normal Distribution}

The Chi-squared distribution is derived from Normal Distribution.
The relationship is not direct, but it is essential to Student's t-distribution, which is low-sample version of Normal Distribution.

\subsection{Mean and Variance}

The mean and variance of the chi-squared distribution is
\begin{align*}
    Mean     & \triangleq E(x) = r             \\
    Variance & \triangleq E(x^2) - E^2(x) = 2r
\end{align*}
it is easy to proof using Proposition \ref{proposition: Gamma function propositions}.
